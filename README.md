## Guidelines

- Fulfil the requirements using TypeScript and React.

- Make use of, but don't change, the dependencies in [`package.json`](package.json).

- Make use of, but don't change, the components in [`src/components/shared`](src/components/shared). See examples in [`src/stories`](src/stories).

- Don't change the tests in [`src/tests`](src/tests).

## Submission

When the tests pass, and the UI resembles the figma design, submit a PR and include your email address with a live url ðŸš€ to your solution .
